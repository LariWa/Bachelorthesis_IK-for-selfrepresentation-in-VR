Building up on the bachelorthesis the paper [Inverse kinematics for full-body self representation in VR-based cognitive rehabilitation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9666140) was published at the _2021 IEEE International Symposium on Multimedia (ISM)_.

## Abstract - Bachelorthesis

In virtual reality applications you often only see your hands from the first-person perspective.
However, it would be more realistic to see a complete representation of your own body. This
can be done through a full-body avatar, which offers many advantages: Users feel more present
[1], can better estimate distances [2] and even cognitive skills can be improved [3].  
For these reasons, a solution for self-representation by an avatar using inverse kinematics is
realized on the example of the VReha research project in this thesis.  
First, existing solutions were evaluated. The best solution was integrated into the research
project VReha and adapted to the project requirements: The avatar can be scaled to fit the user,
sitting, standing and walking. In addition, the solution processes data from different sensors,
adapts to the data availability and supports different avatars.  
A final user study concluded that users prefer representation through an avatar to representation
by hand models, and feel more embodied in the virtual world with an avatar.
